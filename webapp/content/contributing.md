# Contributing

The Good Governance Initiative is a working group hosted at the OW2 forge:

* The [GGI resource center](https://www.ow2.org/view/OSS_Governance/) contains a lot of resources and information from the beginning of the initiative.
* Activities are [elaborated and reviewed as issues](https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/ggi-castalia/-/boards/449) on the GitLab instance.
* Discussions happen on the [public GGI mailing list](https://mail.ow2.org/wws/info/ossgovernance), and we hold bi-monthly meetings. Minutes are available on the mailing list, and meetings are open to everyone.

We are open to contributions, and all our activity is open and public. If you would like to participate, the best way is to register on the mailing list and join the conversation.
