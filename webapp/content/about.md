The [Good Governance Initiative](https://www.ow2.org/view/OSS_Governance) proposes a methodological framework to assess and improve open-source awareness, compliance and governance within organisations.

Organisations -- may they be small or big companies, city councils, or associations -- maximise the benefits derived from open-source when people, processes and technology are aligned and share the same vision. This initiative helps organisations to achieve these goals with:
* An easy-to-understand **assessment program** to identify pain points and evaluate the organisation's current practices.
* A **clear and practical path for improvement**, with small, affordable steps to mitigate risks, educate people, adapt processes, communicate inwards and outwards the organisation's realm.
* **Guidance** and a breadth of **curated references** about open-source licencing, practices, training, and ecosystems, to leverage open-source awareness and culture, consolidate internal knowledge and extend leadership.
* A **certifying process** to help you select the right partners and show your commitment to the world.
